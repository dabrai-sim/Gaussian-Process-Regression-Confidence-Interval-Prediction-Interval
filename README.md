# Gaussian Process Regression, Confidence Interval, Prediction Interval

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) on both artificial and real-world datasets. The project includes:

1. GPR on an artificial dataset where \( y = x \sin(x) \).
2. GPR on a real-world dataset (Air Quality dataset).

## Features
- Implementation of Gaussian Process Regression from scratch.
- Visualization of predictions and confidence intervals.
- Application of GPR on multivariate input data.

## Technical Stack
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Seaborn
